# ts-blog
A simple but efficient blog back-end implementation made using TypeScript, Express, TypeORM and MongoDB.

## purpose
The whole point of this back-end application is to learn more about JWT, authentication, and back-end itself.

## endpoints
You can view a list of all endpoints in the `src/routes/index.ts` file. Every route (such as `/users`, `/articles`, etc.) 
are separated in files and are managed within the `index.ts` file for routes.

## contributing
I don't really think anyone will contribute to this as it's mainly a learning project. Though, if you have any suggestions,
you can either open an issue here or e-mail me at [dev@akkih.com](mailto:dev@akkih.com).

You can also take this code as "inspiration" or whatever, if it fits what you're looking for.
